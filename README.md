# The-Starbucks-Order-From-Hell-Twine-Game
This is a project me and 3 others worked on for our Interactive Storytelling class. It is a funny project about a Grubhub driver who has to bring a complicated Starbucks order to Satan in Chicago. Here lies all the files from the project along with our game bible. The audio and image files are in a separate repository that is also public.
